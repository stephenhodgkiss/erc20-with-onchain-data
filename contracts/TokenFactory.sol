/**
 * Example TokenFactory for deploying simple ERC20 and ERC721 token contracts.
 *
 * This contract demonstrates a factory pattern for token creation, which has some benefits when used with FireFly:
 *   - the blockchain overhead (including gas, etc) is lessened when creating many tokens, as the factory contract
 *     only has to be deployed to the chain once
 *   - allows FireFly to instantiate new tokens via simple API calls
 *
 * This is a sample only and NOT a reference implementation.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract includes both ERC-20 and ERC-721, making the compiled contract very large. This could have
 * significant gas / cost implications which is something to be aware of if you deploy this contract.
 *
 * Just a few of the questions to consider when developing a contract for production:
 *   - is a factory pattern the best solution for your use case, or is a pre-deployed token contract more suitable?
 *   - is a proxy layer needed for contract upgradeability?
 *   - are other extension points beyond "name", "symbol", and "uri" needed (for instance "decimals" or "supply")?
 *
 * See the FireFly documentation for descriptions of the various patterns supported for working with tokens.
 * Please also read the descriptions of the sample ERC20WithData and ERC721WithData contracts utilized by this
 * factory, as they have other important considerations noted specific to each token type.
 *
 * Finally, remember to always consult best practices from other communities and examples (such as OpenZeppelin)
 * when crafting your token logic, rather than relying on the FireFly community alone. Happy minting!
